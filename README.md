## Overview

 This repository is the project for the “Bayesian Machine Learning” course of the MVA master. Our exploration centered around two variants of the traditional PCA: the Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) and the Bayesian PCA (BPCA). We studied these methods from a statistical viewpoint by comparing their performance on a synthetic dataset. Additionally, we explored their potential role in the estimation of missing data.

 ## Structure

**Jupyter Notebooks**: 
* `PPCA.ipynb`: PPCA implementation and comparison with PCA on a synthetic data.
* `BPCA.ipynb`: BPCA implementation and comparison with PCA on a synthetic data.
